Exercise - 1 - creditCardValidator, 
- This program take an integer value for credit_card_number as the input.
- This program is designed to check the validity of the credit_card_number entered by the user.
- First, it checks for the length of the credit_card_number, and returns invalid if the length is less than 8 or greater than 9 
-  it removes the last digit and stores it in a variable; it then converts the remaining digits to a string, the string is reversed, and the digits present on the odd position are doubled and added if the sum is greater than 9, the resultant digits are added, the last digit is subtracted from 10, if the difference is equal to the last digit removed earlier then the is is “valid” else  “invalid”.
 - - -	The algorithm for this program returns valid only if credit_card_number ends with digit 5  and is of the length 8 or 9. - - -
